On Lotus Mountainâ€™s western peak
Far and wide, I spied bright stars
Bearing lotus flowers
Weakly walking for it was not too clear.
Inviting me to its cloudy stage was
Wei Shuqing, guardian angel of Huashan.
Dreamily I went with him,
Riding in the sky on the back of wild geese
Calling as they flew.
At the river, at Luoyang are
Blood is flowing, painting the grass along the river
Covered in jackals like tassels on a cap
